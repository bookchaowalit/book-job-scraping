# book-job-scraping — Producer Brief & Boundary Contract

*Tier A tool flagship (collection / automation). Nested repo:
`projects/product/engineering/book-dev/github/bookchaowalit/book-apps/tools/book-job-scraping`.*

## Who this is for

The operator (you) who needs **job discovery capture** and **application
prep** pipelines without coupling scraper code to Solo Empire control-plane
APIs or the lake consumer.

## What it is / is not

| Is | Is not |
|---|---|
| Collection + matching + draft/prep tooling | Source of record for analytics |
| Writes capture files under this repo’s `data/` | Writer into another app’s database |
| Optional MCP search over local storage | Hosted job API (`:8109`) |
| Gated send/apply (blocked by default) | Always-on auto-apply production system |

## Boundary vs `book-job-data` (contract)

```text
book-job-scraping (this repo)
  → produce capture CSVs / JSON under ./data/
       e.g. job_postings.csv, matched_jobs.csv, apply_tracker.csv
  → does NOT call Solo Empire APIs
  → does NOT write Bronze/Parquet itself

book-job-data (sibling path / public Track B repo)
  → ingest capture files (lake-first landing → Bronze job.v1)
  → lineage + DuckDB/API :8109
  → parent may hold a **compatibility mirror** without nested .git

Solo Empire opportunities / JOB-TRACKER
  → canonical “submitted applications” human record (optional bridge)
```

Default handoff input for ingest:

```bash
# From Solo Empire / book-job-data docs:
python -m book_job_data.ingest \
  --input /path/to/book-job-scraping/data/job_postings.csv \
  --data-lake-uri /path/to/solo-empire/data/lake
```

Env overrides:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BOOK_JOB_SCRAPING_ROOT` | Override repo root |
| `PIPELINE_DATA_DIR` | Override `./data` |
| `BOOK_JOB_SCRAPING_DATA_DIR` | Used by book-job-data when capture dir moves |

See sibling `../book-job-data/README.md` and
`systems/architecture/job-data-contract-v1.yaml` in Solo Empire for schema
ownership (`job.v1`, privacy class internal).

## Safety model (Verified by unit tests)

Live email/ATS paths require **all** of:

1. Explicit CLI flag (`--send` or `--apply`)  
2. `BOOK_JOB_LIVE_SEND_ENABLED=1`  
3. `BOOK_JOB_SEND_UNLOCK=I_UNDERSTAND_LIVE_SEND`  

`auto_apply.py` writes **`prepared`** (not “submitted”).  
`ats_auto_apply.py --test` is preview-only.

Evidence (2026-08-11):

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests/test_paths_and_safety.py -v
# 17 tests OK
```

Extra fix same day: `ats_auto_apply.py` no longer imports `websockets` at
module load — `--test` / dry-run works without the browser venv so safety
gates stay unit-testable.

Full detail: [`SAFETY.md`](./SAFETY.md).

## Architecture notes

- Hexagonal core under `core/` + engine adapters (historical multi-category
  scraping platform narrative in README).  
- Job **application** automation lives mainly under `scripts/` (large surface).  
- Path stabilization: `scripts/repo_paths.py` replaces legacy
  `domains/book-dev/book-scraping` monorepo roots.

## Dirty-tree triage (2026-08-11)

~68 dirty paths. **Dominant cluster: path/safety migration across scripts.**

| Cluster | What | Stance |
|---|---|---|
| A. Path + safety foundation | `scripts/repo_paths.py`, `scripts/safety.py`, `core/config.py`, `SAFETY.md`, `tests/` | Ready for focused review/commit |
| B. Mass script rewrite | ~60 `scripts/*.py` (path migration, gates, no runtime pip) | One logical commit after spot-check of high-risk send scripts |
| C. Config / deps | `config/jobs.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, this PRODUCT | With A or docs commit |
| D. Data | `./data/` runtime (gitignored) | Never commit secrets or live trackers |

**Do not** couple a commit of this tree to parent Solo Empire monorepo commits.
**Do not** enable live send unlock in CI or committed env files.

## Claim hygiene

- **Verified:** Safety unit tests pass; send default-locked; paths resolve under this repo.  
- **Observed:** Scrapers and prep scripts exist; board coverage listed in README.  
- **Planned:** Bridge/retire dual tracker (`data/apply_tracker.csv` vs Solo Empire JOB-TRACKER); optional MCP monetization pricing is **not** production revenue evidence.

## Next improvements

1. Owner-approved nested commit of clusters A → B → C.  
2. Document exact CSV column contract consumed by `book-job-data` ingest (link to job.v1).  
3. Keep live send permanently operator-gated.  
4. Prefer lake ingest for analytics; keep this repo collection-only.

## Status

- **2026-08-06/07:** Path migration + safety gates + SAFETY.md.  
- **2026-08-11:** Producer contract PRODUCT.md; tests re-verified 17/17; no bulk commit.

# Book Job Scraping — Multi-Engine Capture + Job Pipeline

International remote career changes and relocation now have separate review
lanes. See [Career workflow](CAREER-WORKFLOW.md) for public company discovery,
review packets, exact-document preparation and receipt-backed manual
submission tracking. Live automated ATS submission remains unverified.

Hexagonal-architecture scraping platform with 5 engines, scheduled jobs,
MCP search over local storage, and a **job application prep** pipeline.

**Canonical nested path:**
`projects/product/engineering/book-dev/github/bookchaowalit/book-apps/tools/book-job-scraping/`
**Architecture:** Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)
**Engines:** httpx+BS4, Playwright, Selenium, Scrapy, RSS
**Categories:** Jobs, E-commerce, Restaurants, Directories, News, Property

**Producer contract / safety:** see [`PRODUCT.md`](./PRODUCT.md) and
[`SAFETY.md`](./SAFETY.md). This repo is **collection + prep only** —
durable lake analytics live in sibling **`book-job-data`** (ingest capture
CSVs → Bronze `job.v1` → API `:8109`). Do not write Solo Empire SQLite or
another app DB from here.

## Scheduled Jobs

Jobs are defined in `config/jobs.yaml`. The installed local cron invokes
`main.py run` every five minutes, so only jobs due at that moment are run.
The scheduler state is written to `data/schedule_state.json`.

The coverage registry still holds `flight_prices` and `ddproperty_condos`
behind their source gates, and holds `property_social_leads` as conditional
until a bounded public-search smoke and terms review pass. The
former cross-source `money_opportunities` lane was retired with the shared
opportunity synthesis; it is no longer scheduled or a collection target.
`ddproperty_condos` has a Thai `__NEXT_DATA__` parser and fixture but live
collection hits a Cloudflare JS challenge. `seo_rankings` is enabled as a
public-page provenance check (no SERP ranks on the free path). News RSS jobs
are migrated to `book-news-scraping` (`scripts/run_feeds.py`, cron every 2
hours). `notebookspec_tech` was enabled after a
dedicated RSS adapter returned 20 attributed canonical articles.
`wongnai_upcountry` is enabled after a three-page live HTML smoke returned 28
unique restaurants across Khon Kaen, Korat, and Pattaya with city attribution.
`ai_tools` is enabled
after a six-page Futurepedia HTML smoke returned 62 unique tools with category
and canonical URL attribution. `wongnai_bangkok` is enabled after a three-page
live HTML smoke returned 161 unique Bangkok-attributed restaurants.
`crypto_prices` is enabled after the CoinGecko API smoke returned 20 validated
rows. `exchange_rates` is enabled after a Frankfurter smoke returned 10
validated rates, and `stock_prices` is enabled after Yahoo Finance returned 9
validated ticker rows. `kaidee_classifieds` is enabled after a live HTML smoke
returned 8 priced canonical listings. Re-enable other sources only after a
focused smoke test produces a trustworthy contract-compliant result.
`matichon_news` is enabled after its RSS smoke returned 50 attributed canonical
articles. `thai_business_news` is enabled after its RSS smoke returned 10
attributed canonical business articles. `thai_tech_news` is enabled after its
Blognone RSS smoke returned 10 attributed canonical technology articles.
`defi_yields` is migrated to `book-defi-data` after a Firefox-UA live smoke
returned 20 validated Ethereum pools with a provider timestamp within the
24-hour freshness bound. The domain cron uses the same five-chain production
bounds as the previous local job.

The four planned portal adapters (`ennxo`, `propertyhub`, `livinginsider`, and
`zmyhome`) write separate `property_<source>_listings.csv` supply snapshots.
They use source-specific selectors, canonical detail URLs, positive-price
filters, and public contact fields that remain pending human review. They do
not write the Pantip-only `property-demand.v1` handoff. Keep these jobs
disabled until source terms, robots observations, retention, and the public
contact storage basis are documented.

### Multi-business source coverage

`config/source_coverage.yaml` is the coverage registry for the shared
acquisition platform. It maps every scheduler job to a business lane, source,
acquisition channel, output contract, implementation status, and restoration
priority. The preferred acquisition order is API, CLI, RSS, then scraping;
`hybrid` entries may combine an API with bounded HTML fallback.

```bash
python scripts/source_coverage.py --check
python scripts/source_coverage.py
python scripts/source_coverage.py --json
```

The validator fails if coverage drifts from `config/jobs.yaml`, an enabled
adapter module is missing, or a source has no contract/next action. This keeps
business coverage broad without making every downstream application scrape
independently.

The DDproperty adapter writes its collection-only snapshot to
`data/exported/ddproperty_condos.csv` and reuses the shared property parser;
it does not own matching, alerts, or downstream business decisions.

Property rows now include explicit public contact fields (`contact_role`,
`co_agent_status`, phone/email/LINE, and platform URLs), the source URL and a
short evidence snippet.  `lead_review_status=co_agent_candidate` is only a
review queue signal; it never sends outreach or proves that a person is the
owner.  Every row also starts with `review_decision=pending` and
`outreach_status=not_contacted`; a reviewer must record the decision before any
outreach status can advance.  The social lead adapter searches publicly
indexed Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LINE URLs and stores result metadata in
`data/exported/property_social_leads.csv`.  It queries the official Brave
Search API only; it does not scrape the search UI, authenticate to, crawl, or
bypass private social content.  Persisting API results requires a Brave plan
that explicitly grants storage rights, plus source-terms/PDPA review and
human contact-quality review.  Keep the job disabled until those gates pass.

### Public property-seeker demand (direct HTTP only)

The demand lane is separate from `property.v1` listing/owner captures. It uses
`scripts/scrape_property_demand.py` to fetch only public Pantip search and topic
HTML with `httpx`; it does not use browser automation, author profiles, login
sessions, or private groups. `robots.txt`, an HTTPS Pantip host allowlist,
redirect and response-size bounds, request pacing, and a topic limit are
enforced by the collector. The command is a dry run by default and is not
registered with the scheduler.

```bash
python scripts/scrape_property_demand.py \
  --query "หาคอนโดเช่า" --limit 10 --dry-run --json
python scripts/scrape_property_demand.py \
  --url https://pantip.com/topic/44155476 --dry-run --json
```

For a larger handoff, repeat several public search queries and use the bounded
100-topic ceiling. Parsed records are ordered by `posted_at` newest-first;
records without a trustworthy timestamp remain at the end for review:

```bash
python scripts/scrape_property_demand.py \
  --query "หาคอนโดเช่า" \
  --query "หาเช่าคอนโด" \
  --query "หาห้องเช่า" \
  --query "หาบ้านเช่า" \
  --query "หาซื้อคอนโด" \
  --query "อยากซื้อบ้าน" \
  --limit 100 --max-age-days 30 --dry-run --json
```

First-person seeker text is written to `property-demand.v1` fields only after
the parser separates it from listing, owner, agent, and co-agent language.
Missing or stale post timestamps become `needs_more_evidence`; otherwise the
default remains `permission_needed`. A public topic URL is a review path, not
permission to call, and the collector never enriches a phone number from a
profile or hidden page. `call_ready` is reserved for a later human decision and
is never emitted automatically.

Persisting a review packet requires an explicit retention deadline and a
source-terms reference. The default CSV handoff is UTF-8 with BOM so Thai text
opens correctly in spreadsheet tools; it contains only `call_ready`,
`permission_needed`, and `needs_more_evidence` rows. `not_demand` rows are
excluded. JSONL remains available with `--format jsonl` for replay/debugging:

```bash
python scripts/scrape_property_demand.py --persist \
  --retention-until 2026-12-31T00:00:00Z \
  --terms-basis-ref "human-reviewed-public-source-terms" \
  --query "หาคอนโดเช่า"
```

The default output is `data/exported/property_demand.csv`; use `--output` to
choose another handoff path. This lane never writes Solo Empire CRM/SQLite and
never sends outreach. The CSV is a review handoff, not permission to contact.

The contract is [`contracts/property-demand.v1.json`](contracts/property-demand.v1.json).

### Major-source audit

Run the bounded HTTP/robots audit alongside the demand handoff:

```bash
python scripts/audit_property_demand_sources.py \
  --output data/exported/property_demand_source_audit.csv --json
```

The audit records source metadata only. It keeps major portals such as Kaidee,
ENNXO, PropertyHub, RentHub, LivingInsider, Zmyhome, Meezub, DotProperty,
Baania, and Hipflat visible, but marks their sale/rent pages as
`exclude_demand` because they publish supply listings rather than first-person
buyer/renter requests. DDproperty remains blocked. Reddit and ASEANN remain
blocked until an approved API/export path is available. Facebook public groups
are `manual_export_only` and must use the existing user-selected public export
flow; this command never crawls them.

The row shape is versioned in
[`contracts/property-capture.v1.json`](contracts/property-capture.v1.json).
Validate a persisted social capture without printing contact values before
lake ingest:

```bash
python scripts/check_property_social_capture.py \
  data/exported/property_social_leads.csv --json --require-governance
```

Run the complete social extraction and review flow locally with the synthetic
fixture; this mode is offline and does not need an API key:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/property-social-fixture
python scripts/scrape_property_social.py \
  --fixture tests/fixtures/property_social_results.json \
  --limit 20 --output-dir /tmp/property-social-fixture
python scripts/check_property_social_capture.py \
  /tmp/property-social-fixture/property_social_leads.csv --json
```

Fixture rows are synthetic examples for parser and workflow checks. They do
not prove live source access or permit enabling the scheduled collector.

### Owner / co-agent capture from a browser export

The repository now has a manual, offline bridge for the sources that publish
explicit owner or cooperation wording.  It accepts a CSV/JSON export from the
included Chrome extension or another browser exporter and keeps only rows
whose visible text contains an explicit owner/co-agent signal.  The current
allowlist includes `zmyhome.com`, `meezub.com`, `ennxo.com`,
`livinginsider.com`, the configured property portals, and public URLs on
Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LINE.  A URL is never fetched by the
importer; unsupported, non-HTTPS, or look-alike hosts are quarantined.
DDproperty remains blocked by its source terms and is not accepted by this
manual importer.

To use the included extension, open the `chrome-extension/` directory in
`chrome://extensions` with **Developer mode → Load unpacked**.  On a public
listing or public search page that you opened yourself, click **Capture public
property lead**, check the visible evidence, save the row, then click
**Export CSV for importer**.  The extension stores rows locally in Chrome and
does not call a backend.  It is a capture aid, not a social crawler: do not
use it on private groups, do not bypass a login or access control, and do not
export browser history or cookies.

Import the downloaded file with the following command:

```bash
python scripts/import_property_leads.py \
  --input ~/Downloads/property_owner_coagent_export.csv \
  --output-dir data/exported
```

The command writes `property_owner_coagent_leads.csv`, an append-only history,
a redacted quarantine report, a checksum manifest, and a local copy of the
input bytes.  Rows start with `review_decision=pending` and
`outreach_status=not_contacted`; no message is sent.  Use
`--include-unqualified` only when you intentionally want a wider manual
review queue.  For a completely offline smoke test:

```bash
python scripts/import_property_leads.py \
  --input tests/fixtures/property_owner_coagent_export.csv \
  --output-dir /tmp/property-owner-coagent-sample
python scripts/check_property_capture.py \
  /tmp/property-owner-coagent-sample/property_owner_coagent_leads.csv --json
```

The fixture is synthetic.  Live owner/co-agent evidence must come from the
public page or export the reviewer actually inspected, and source terms,
privacy purpose, retention, and contact approval still need a human decision
before any CRM or outreach handoff.

### Facebook Group post capture (free, user-selected)

The extension also has **Capture Facebook Group posts**.  Open the Group in a
Chrome tab you are allowed to use, load the extension, click the button, and
select only the rendered posts that have a permalink.  It reads the current
DOM only; it does not scroll automatically, call Facebook APIs, open another
post, read cookies, or send a request.  Confirm the Group visibility in the
popup before saving.  The current pass intentionally captures the posts
already rendered on screen; scroll yourself and use the popup's **Capture next
rendered page** button for another page of results.

Export with **Export Facebook Group CSV**, then run the offline importer:

```bash
python scripts/import_facebook_group_posts.py \
  --input ~/Downloads/facebook_group_posts_export.csv \
  --output-dir data/exported
python scripts/check_facebook_group_capture.py \
  data/exported/facebook_group_posts.csv --json
```

If you only want the posts in the current draft, use **Export current capture
CSV** before saving.  It downloads `facebook_group_current_capture.csv` and
does not clear or add to the saved-posts store.  **Export Facebook Group CSV**
continues to export the posts already saved in the extension.

The popup keeps the capture list while it is open and also stores a bounded
local draft (up to 500 posts, expiring after 24 hours), because Chrome may close
a popup when you return to the tab to scroll.  Reopen the popup and click
**Capture next rendered page**; the next batch is merged by canonical
`post_url` and the better text/metadata copy wins.  Click **Clear capture draft**
when starting over.  This avoids having to save each viewport separately while
still keeping the capture bounded to the posts visible in the tab.

Run the synthetic smoke before using a real export.  It makes no network
request and contains only fake values:

```bash
python scripts/import_facebook_group_posts.py \
  --input tests/fixtures/facebook_group_posts_export.csv \
  --output-dir /tmp/facebook-group-fixture
python scripts/check_facebook_group_capture.py \
  /tmp/facebook-group-fixture/facebook_group_posts.csv --json
```

The validator reports accepted row count, visibility counts, incomplete text,
duplicate URLs/IDs, candidate count, and pending-review count.  Use
`--require-complete` when a downstream step must reject any post whose visible
text still contains a “See more” boundary.  Warnings never approve outreach;
rows still start at `review_decision=pending` and `outreach_status=not_contacted`.

Review selected rows after checking the original Group tab.  The command only
records a decision and keeps outreach locked:

```bash
python scripts/review_facebook_group_posts.py \
  --input data/exported/facebook_group_posts.csv \
  --rows 1,3 --decision approved --reviewer-id owner-1 \
  --output data/exported/facebook_group_posts_reviewed.csv
python scripts/check_facebook_group_capture.py \
  data/exported/facebook_group_posts_reviewed.csv --json
```

The row contract is versioned in
[`contracts/facebook-group-post.v1.json`](contracts/facebook-group-post.v1.json).
The importer canonicalises Facebook Group/post URLs, removes tracking query
parameters, deduplicates posts, extracts explicit owner/co-agent signals from
the supplied post text, and starts every row at `review_decision=pending` and
`outreach_status=not_contacted`.  Public rows remain available for review even
when they have no owner signal; use `--candidates-only` when you want a strict
owner/co-agent queue.  Private or `unknown` rows are quarantined by default.
To process a row from a group you are authorised to use, pass both an explicit
gate and governance references:

```bash
python scripts/import_facebook_group_posts.py \
  --input ~/Downloads/facebook_group_posts_export.csv \
  --allow-private --allow-unknown \
  --retention-until 2026-12-31T00:00:00Z \
  --terms-basis-ref group-owner-approved-2026-09-14 \
  --output-dir data/exported
```

This does not bypass a login or make private content public.  The output is a
review queue, not a CRM write or outreach trigger.  A synthetic no-network
smoke test is available at
`tests/fixtures/facebook_group_posts_export.csv`; it does not prove live
Facebook access.

### Background capture without the extension (opt-in)

Use `scripts/scrape_facebook_group_background.py` when you want a local
Playwright process instead of the popup.  It opens only the Group URLs in a
local text/JSON file, reads rendered `[role="article"]` nodes, performs a
bounded number of manual-equivalent scroll rounds, and writes the same raw CSV
shape with `capture_method=playwright_visible_tab`.  It is not scheduled by
`setup_cron.sh`.

Create a dedicated browser profile outside the repository.  The first command
opens a headed browser so you can log in or complete a checkpoint yourself;
the runner never exports or prints cookies:

If Debian/Ubuntu reports that `ensurepip` is unavailable, install the matching
venv package once, then recreate the project environment:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.14-venv
python3 -m venv --clear .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install playwright
.venv/bin/python -m playwright install-deps chromium
```

The shorter install above is sufficient for this runner; install the full
`requirements.txt` only when using the other scrapers in this repository.

```bash
.venv/bin/playwright install chromium
.venv/bin/python scripts/scrape_facebook_group_background.py \
  --profile-dir ~/.local/share/solo-empire/facebook-playwright \
  --login-only --headed
```

Then create a local URL list and run a bounded headless capture:

```text
# /tmp/facebook-groups.txt
https://facebook.com/groups/your-authorised-group
```

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/scrape_facebook_group_background.py \
  --groups-file /tmp/facebook-groups.txt \
  --profile-dir ~/.local/share/solo-empire/facebook-playwright \
  --output /tmp/facebook-group-background.csv \
  --rounds 3 --pause-ms 1500 --visibility public
```

Before using a real Group, run the browser path against the synthetic fixture;
the `--fixture` option serves the document locally, aborts other intercepted
page requests, and never navigates to Facebook:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/scrape_facebook_group_background.py \
  --group-url https://facebook.com/groups/demo \
  --profile-dir /tmp/facebook-background-fixture-profile \
  --fixture tests/fixtures/facebook_group_background.html \
  --output /tmp/facebook-group-background-fixture.csv \
  --rounds 1 --visibility public
```

The optional user-level systemd templates in
[`ops/systemd/`](ops/systemd/) run the same bounded command every six hours.
They are examples only: copy and edit them yourself after the one-time
headed login and a successful fixture/live dry run.  The repository does not
install this timer automatically.

The default `--visibility auto` fails closed when the page does not expose
explicit public/private wording.  After visually confirming that every Group
in the file is public, `--visibility public` records that operator label.  If
the Groups have mixed or unclear visibility, use `--allow-unknown`; the
importer still quarantines those rows unless its explicit governance gate is
supplied.  A private Group additionally requires
`--allow-private`, `--retention-until`, and `--terms-basis-ref`, and those same
values must be passed to the importer.  The browser profile is an
authentication boundary: keep it outside Git, never use another person's
profile, and do not run this against a Group you are not authorised to use.

Record that human decision locally after checking the source page.  The review
command uses one-based data row numbers (the header is not counted), refuses to
edit a row that was already reviewed, and keeps `outreach_status=not_contacted`:

```bash
python scripts/review_property_leads.py \
  --input data/exported/property_owner_coagent_leads.csv \
  --rows 1,3-4 --decision approved --reviewer-id owner-1 \
  --output data/exported/property_owner_coagent_leads_reviewed.csv
python scripts/check_property_capture.py \
  data/exported/property_owner_coagent_leads_reviewed.csv --json
```

Use `--list-pending` to print only row numbers and status counts, or
`--all-pending` to apply one decision to every pending row.  Each write also
appends `property_owner_coagent_review_history.csv` with reviewer metadata and
URL/input hashes; it never copies contact values into the audit file.  An
approved review is evidence for a later, separately authorized outreach step,
not an automatic message permission.

The TG Condo adapter is the first live no-key RSS property source in this lane. It
reads only the site's public condo-rent RSS endpoint (no search-page crawl) and
writes `tgcondo_condo_rent_raw.xml`, `tgcondo_condo_rent.csv`, and
`tgcondo_condo_rent_history.csv`. Run a bounded live sample outside the repo's
runtime data directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/tgcondo-live-sample
python scripts/scrape_tgcondo_rss.py \
  --limit 5 --output-dir /tmp/tgcondo-live-sample
```

The feed contains listing metadata and usually no owner/co-agent signal, so
those fields remain `unknown` unless the publisher states them explicitly.
The scheduled `tgcondo_condo_rent` job stays disabled while source terms,
raw-result retention, and contact-data handling are reviewed. An optional
contact sample is capped at five public listing pages and requires all three
governance variables (`TGCONDO_CONTACT_STORAGE_APPROVED=1`,
`TGCONDO_RETENTION_UNTIL`, and `TGCONDO_TERMS_BASIS_REF`); it reads visible
agent-card text only and never submits a contact form:

```bash
TGCONDO_CONTACT_STORAGE_APPROVED=1 \
TGCONDO_RETENTION_UNTIL=approved-deletion-deadline \
TGCONDO_TERMS_BASIS_REF=internal-source-review \
python scripts/scrape_tgcondo_rss.py --include-agent-contact --max-contacts 5 \
  --limit 5 --output-dir /tmp/tgcondo-contact-sample
```

The crypto adapter writes the validated raw response to
`data/exported/crypto_prices_raw.json` and the capture projections to
`data/exported/crypto_prices.csv` and `data/exported/crypto_history.csv`.
Lake-first ingestion and the read-only API remain owned by `book-crypto-data`.

The FX adapter writes the validated Frankfurter response to
`data/exported/exchange_rates_raw.json` and the capture projections to
`data/exported/exchange_rates.csv` and `data/exported/exchange_history.csv`.
Lake-first ingestion and the read-only API remain owned by `book-fx-data`.

The stock adapter writes the validated Yahoo Finance chart responses to
`data/exported/stock_prices_raw.json` and the capture projections to
`data/exported/stock_prices.csv` and `data/exported/stock_history.csv`.
Lake-first ingestion and the read-only API remain owned by `book-finance-data`.

The Kaidee adapter writes the validated embedded page payload to
`data/exported/kaidee_classifieds_raw.json` and the capture projections to
`data/exported/kaidee_classifieds.csv` and
`data/exported/kaidee_classifieds_history.csv`. It is collection-only; durable
marketplace lake/API ownership remains with the downstream marketplace data
product.

The Matichon adapter writes the raw RSS response to
`data/exported/matichon_news_raw.xml` and the capture projections to
`data/exported/matichon_news.csv` and
`data/exported/matichon_news_history.csv`. It is collection-only; durable news
lake/API ownership remains with the downstream news data product.

The Bangkok Post Business adapter writes the raw RSS response to
`data/exported/thai_business_news_raw.xml` and the capture projections to
`data/exported/thai_business_news.csv` and
`data/exported/thai_business_news_history.csv`. It is collection-only; durable
business-news lake/API ownership remains with the downstream news data
product.

The Blognone adapter writes the raw Atom-compatible response to
`data/exported/thai_tech_news_raw.xml` and the capture projections to
`data/exported/thai_tech_news.csv` and
`data/exported/thai_tech_news_history.csv`. It is collection-only; durable
technology-news lake/API ownership remains with the downstream news data
product.

The Wongnai adapter writes bounded raw HTML pages to
`data/exported/wongnai_bangkok_raw.json` and the capture projections to
`data/exported/wongnai_bangkok.csv` and
`data/exported/wongnai_bangkok_history.csv`. It reads the embedded
`window._wn` state, validates canonical restaurant URLs, and filters every row
to Bangkok city attribution before writing collection-only output.

The same adapter writes the upcountry capture to
`data/exported/wongnai_upcountry_raw.json`,
`data/exported/wongnai_upcountry.csv`, and
`data/exported/wongnai_upcountry_history.csv`. The enabled upcountry job uses
three bounded pages and keeps only rows attributed to `khonkaen`, `korat`, or
`pattaya` (including Chon Buri city labels for Pattaya).

The AI tools adapter writes bounded Futurepedia HTML pages to
`data/exported/ai_tools_raw.json` and the capture projections to
`data/exported/ai_tools.csv` and `data/exported/ai_tools_history.csv`. It
validates canonical `/tool/<slug>` URLs and preserves category, rating, pricing,
description, and source attribution for collection-only discovery output.

The DeFi adapter now runs from `book-defi-data`. It writes the validated
DefiLlama response to `book-defi-data/data/exported/defi_yields_raw.json`
and the capture projections to `defi_yields.csv` and
`defi_yields_history.csv`. It uses a Firefox User-Agent, normalizes the
`Optimism` configuration alias to DefiLlama's `OP Mainnet`, requires finite
APY/TVL and unique pool IDs, and rejects stale provider responses.

### Data Freshness Strategy

| Data Type | Frequency | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Discovery feeds | Daily | Trending and time-sensitive sources |
| Jobs | Every 6h | New postings expire quickly |
| Job matching | Daily | Refresh scored opportunities |
| Property | Daily | New listings appear frequently |
| Dashboard | 3 times daily | Keep operational view current |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies in the repository venv
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers (for JS-rendered pages)
playwright install chromium

# Copy config and edit
cp .env.example .env

# Run all due jobs now
python main.py run

# Run a specific configured job
python main.py run job_postings

# Install or inspect the five-minute local cron
bash setup_cron.sh install
bash setup_cron.sh status

# Check schedule status
python main.py status

# Run the direct job capture/matching path
python scripts/scrape_job_postings.py
python scripts/filter_job_matches.py

# Run MCP server
python -m mcp_server.server
```

### Collection health

The collection path is the authoritative default health mode. It checks the
four core artifacts and does not require optional AI enrichment or outbound
notifications:

```bash
python scripts/pipeline_runner.py --health
python scripts/pipeline_health_monitor.py
```

The cron entry runs `pipeline_health_monitor.py` after each collection run and
uses `flock` to prevent overlapping runs. Use `--send-telegram` only when an
operator has explicitly approved an external notification.

## Engine Decision Tree

| Engine | Best For | Speed | Complexity |
|--------|----------|-------|------------|
| **RSS/Atom** | Blogs, news, podcasts | Fastest | Lowest |
| **httpx + BS4** | Static HTML, APIs | Fast | Low |
| **Playwright** | SPAs, JS-rendered, screenshots | Medium | Medium |
| **Selenium** | Complex interactions, legacy sites | Slow | High |
| **Scrapy** | Large crawls (10K+ pages) | Fast | High |

1. Can you get data via RSS/API? → `rss`
2. Is the HTML in source (no JS needed)? → `httpx`
3. Does the page need JS to render? → `playwright`
4. Does the page need login/click/scroll? → `playwright` or `selenium`
5. Need to crawl 10,000+ pages? → `scrapy`

## Job Application Automation Pipeline

> **Safety (2026-08):** Live send/apply is **disabled by default**. See [`SAFETY.md`](./SAFETY.md).
> Paths resolve to this repo’s `data/` directory (not the old monorepo `domains/book-dev/book-scraping` layout).
> `auto_apply.py` only **prepares** drafts (`status=prepared`); it does not submit applications.
> ATS/email live paths require explicit unlock env vars in addition to `--apply` / `--send`.

The job scraping pipeline automates discovery, matching, and application tracking for remote dev jobs.

The targeting policy also has a separate bridge-to-hire lane for
`Contract-to-hire`, `Paid trial`, `Apprenticeship`, `Fellowship`, `Internship`,
and `Volunteer` signals.  A bounded volunteer or open-source contribution is
useful for portfolio, maintainer references, and network—not proof of a job
offer—so it remains `VERIFY`/review-only.  Paid bridge programs can reach
`PASS` only after a human records compensation, scope/duration, mentor,
conversion/reference path, Thailand eligibility, compatible hours, and a
contractor boundary.  Upfront fees, income-share entry, and indefinite unpaid
production work are rejected.

### Data Flow

```
scrape_job_postings.py
    → job_postings.csv (latest snapshot, all sources)
    → config/job_targeting.yaml (contract-first + bridge PASS / VERIFY / REJECT)
    → matched_jobs.csv (PASS first, VERIFY review-only, REJECT excluded)
    → job_descriptions.csv (top matched descriptions, optional enrichment)
    → apply_tracker.csv (via auto_seed_tracker.py, discovered/prepared statuses)
    → resume_variants/ (local application-prep variants)
```

### Supported Job Boards

| Source | Method | Company Extraction |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| WeWorkRemotely | HTML scrape | Regex + URL slug fallback |
| RemoteOK | API | API field |
| Remotive | API | API field |
| Himalayas | API | API field |
| Jobicy | API | API field |
| Landing.jobs | API | API field + URL slug fallback |
| Arc.dev | API | API field + URL slug fallback |
| Dice | HTML scrape | Regex + context analysis |
| Wellfound | API | API field |
| LinkedIn | Scrape | HTML parsing |

### Company Extraction Strategy

For sources where API/HTML parsing fails, the pipeline uses URL slug extraction as a fallback:

```python
# Example: weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/proxify-ab-senior-fullstack-developer
# → Extracts "Proxify Ab" by splitting slug and stopping at job keywords
```

The `_extract_company_from_url()` function handles source-specific URL patterns and uses keyword-boundary detection to isolate company names from job titles.

### Data Quality & Backfill

The pipeline includes data quality recovery mechanisms:

- **Backfill from source files**: Missing company/title values are recovered from `matched_jobs.csv` and `job_postings.csv` by URL lookup
- **URL-based extraction**: For rows not in source files, company names are extracted from URL patterns
- **Status-aware recovery**: Rows with `notified` or `applying` status are prioritized for recovery

Latest verified runtime snapshot (2026-08-24; data is gitignored and will
change on the next run):
- `job_postings.csv`: 1,647 rows
- `matched_jobs.csv`: 118 rows
- `apply_tracker.csv`: 106 rows, all seeded as `discovered` (no submission)
- `job_descriptions.csv`: 10 rows
- `resume_variants/`: 5 configured variants

### Pipeline Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scrape_job_postings.py` | Main scraper — fetches from 10+ job boards |
| `scrape_job_descriptions.py` | Fetches descriptions for top matched jobs |
| `filter_job_matches.py` | Scores and filters the latest postings |
| `auto_seed_tracker.py` | Seeds `apply_tracker.csv` from `matched_jobs.csv` |
| `multi_resume_manager.py` | Initializes and lists application-prep variants |
| `pipeline_runner.py` | Runs collection-mode health and optional pipeline steps |
| `pipeline_health_monitor.py` | Checks disk, scheduler, data freshness, and optional integrations |
| `send_application_emails.py` | Sends application emails to recruiters |
| `auto_send_email.py` | Automated email sending with follow-ups |
| `find_recruiter_emails.py` | Discovers recruiter contacts from company data |

The scheduled search uses international remote sources plus Fastwork,
PeoplePerHour, and Toptal. It includes contract-to-hire, paid-trial,
apprenticeship, fellowship, and volunteer discovery keywords without adding a
second scheduler or auto-application path. Generic JobThai/JobBKK full-time
collection is not scheduled. Downstream promotion and draft preparation accept `PASS` only;
live email/ATS submission additionally requires a human-recorded
`application_readiness=APPROVED` and the independent live-send unlock gates.
Each scheduled match refresh also seeds new `PASS` rows into the local tracker
as `discovered`; it does not notify or submit them.

### Running the Pipeline

```bash
# From this repo root, with project venv activated
python scripts/scrape_job_postings.py
python scripts/filter_job_matches.py
python scripts/scrape_job_descriptions.py --top 10
python scripts/auto_seed_tracker.py --min-score 5
python scripts/multi_resume_manager.py --init
python scripts/pipeline_runner.py --health

# Prepare drafts only (does not submit)
python scripts/auto_apply.py --dry-run

# Application emails — dry-run by default; live send is gated (see SAFETY.md)
python scripts/send_application_emails.py
```
